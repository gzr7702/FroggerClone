FroggerClone: a clone of the frogger game
===============================

Try to get accross the street, or get run over.

To run the app:

To use the node/express hosting, just download the entire app and do an npm install from the root directory.
Run the command: node server.js

If you just want to run the game on your computer, simply point your browser to public/index.html
It might be cleaner to pull everyting from the public directory and put it in its own directory.
